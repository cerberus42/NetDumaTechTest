Welcome to the Address Book Project written in C#

Features are as follows: 
	Connecting to a azure database
	Adding a person to the database
	Removing a person from the database
	Searching the database
	Sorting the database
	
Bugs:
	Connecting to a local database and making it run locally on the machine the user is on rather using the connection string from the development machine
	Resizing the window exessively causes the buffer to get confused and delete text on screen
What I can do better?
	Structure the code better
	Add in modifying an existing contact
